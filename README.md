# Decription of the code organisation for the CV branch.

## Packages

The list of packages and their versions used for the CV module has been included in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

## Organisation

PepperCV directory contains (at the moment) 3 directories:

1) ```src``` -> directory for scripts for functions, classes etc. specific for the CV module to be used in the ```main.py``` script. It also should contain notebooks for training models.

2) ```tests``` -> directory used to conduct tests of software.

3) ```utils``` -> directory for utility code/files. This includes ```PepperAPI``` and saved models in the ```models``` subdirectory.


Feel free to modify this.
